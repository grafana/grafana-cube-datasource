# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- **JSON query viewer**: When a query contains features the visual editor cannot represent (e.g. time dimensions), the query editor switches to a read-only JSON viewer with syntax highlighting and a compiled SQL preview (#58)
- **All Cube filter operators**: Support all Cube filter operators (`contains`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `set`, `notSet`, `inDateRange`, and more) and measure filters via panel JSON (#58)
- **AND/OR filter groups**: Support logical AND/OR filter groups for complex conditions via panel JSON (#58)
- **Advanced filter hint**: The visual builder shows a hint linking to the Cube filter docs for users who need advanced filtering features

## 0.1.4 (2026-02-13)

### Changed in 0.1.4

- Set minimum supported Grafana version to `12.2.5` based on patched Grafana plugin backward-compatibility support for jsx-runtime externalization.

- Use `12.3.3` as the default local development target while keeping `12.2.5` as the minimum supported version.

## 0.1.3 (2026-02-12)

### Fixed in 0.1.3

- Externalize `react/jsx-runtime` and `react/jsx-dev-runtime` to keep frontend bundle behavior compatible with React 19
- Remove invalid alerting receiver from local provisioning to unblock React 19 preview startup during validation

### Changed in 0.1.3
