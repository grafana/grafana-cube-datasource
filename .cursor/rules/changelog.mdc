# Changelog Maintenance

**Update CHANGELOG.md when bumping the version in package.json.**

## When to Update

When bumping the version in `package.json`, add a new section to CHANGELOG.md:

1. Review commits/PRs since the last release tag
2. Add a new section with the version number and today's date
3. Summarize the notable changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)
4. Add a "Full Changelog" comparison link

## Format

```markdown
## X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Features

- **Short description**: Longer explanation if needed (#PR)

### Bug Fixes

- **Short description**: Longer explanation if needed (#PR)

**Full Changelog**: [vPREVIOUS...vX.Y.Z](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-cube-datasource/compare/vPREVIOUS...vX.Y.Z)
```

## What to Include

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes (with migration notes if applicable)

## What to Skip

- Dependency updates (handled by Renovate)
- CI/infrastructure changes (unless they affect users)
- Minor refactors that don't change behavior
