# Testing Rules

## General Testing Philosophy

**Write minimal tests that are just sufficient to verify behaviour.**

- Use the least amount of test data required to reproduce or illustrate the issue
- Prefer fewer assertions that directly verify the expected behaviour
- Avoid verbose setup when a simpler configuration would suffice

## Playwright Testing

**Use non-interactive reporter when running Playwright tests.**

- The default reporter serves an interactive HTML report that blocks with "Press Ctrl+C to quit"
- Use `--reporter=list` for clean, non-interactive output
- This is especially important in "Run Everything" Agent mode

✅ **Correct:**
```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

❌ **Incorrect:**
```bash
npx playwright test  # Blocks waiting for human input
```
