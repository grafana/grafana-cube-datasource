# Dependency Management

**All dependencies must be pinned (exact versions without caret ^ or tilde ~).**

- Always use exact versions like `"16.3.0"` instead of `"^16.3.0"` or `"~16.3.0"`
- This is required for Renovate compatibility and ensures deterministic builds
- When updating dependencies, remove any version range operators (^, ~) and use exact versions
- Check `package.json` to ensure all dependencies follow this pattern

## Examples

✅ **Correct dependency versions:**
```json
"@testing-library/react": "16.3.0"
"react": "18.3.1"
```

❌ **Incorrect dependency versions:**
```json
"@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0"
"react": "~18.3.1"
```
