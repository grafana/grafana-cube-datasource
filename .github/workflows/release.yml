# Creates GitHub releases with downloadable artifacts when version tags are pushed.
# This runs in addition to the CD workflow (publish.yaml) which publishes to the Grafana catalog.
#
# To create a release:
#   1. Bump version: npm version patch|minor|major
#   2. Push with tags: git push --follow-tags
#
# The workflow will create a draft GitHub release with:
#   - Signed plugin zip files for all platforms
#   - SHA checksums
#   - Provenance attestation
#
# For more information, see https://github.com/grafana/plugin-actions/blob/main/build-plugin/README.md
